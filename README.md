# Comparative-Study-of-DNN-architectures-for-Text-Classification

Studied the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Hierarchical Attention Neural Networks (HAN) on text classification

The Jupyter notebooks associated with each architecture can be found in their separate folders
